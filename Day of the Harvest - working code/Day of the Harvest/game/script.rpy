    You know, Anders, you might have what it takes to be an exec after all. What do you say? "

    e "All your dicipline has paid off.
    All your hours of grind, all your sacrifices."
    e "The saws come towards your soft flesh and you do not flinch as they open you up. The pain is excrutiating, but you have come much too far to let that stop you. "
    e" Piece by piece, they peel off the parts of yourself that you don't need. You are a perfect engine of profit, a being with none of the weaknesses you once had.
    Last is your heart."
    e" You weren't using it much anyway.
    Your bonus is going to be huge this quarter.
    No more sleep. No more need for dreams when your dream has finally been realized, after all."

    e "Your new body is so sharp. The world is so bright, moves so slowly. So much noise, so many angles you can view.
    Behind the veil of this world is an endless series of transactions, a perfect system where energy all moves towards those who truly deserve it."
    e" You are so very beautiful now.
    The numbers are good. "


    e "You recieved the promotion you were working for after all. So many bodies, and you should be proud! But even though you are an exec, you aren't a CEO yet - there's still worlds of profit to be made."

    e "You think of his blood gushing from the jagged slash in his throat, of the pool of gore at the bottom of the pit as your underlings held the sacrifices down and drained them."
    e "The sound of rumbling deep in the pit."
    e "A great machine roared to life, refueled."
